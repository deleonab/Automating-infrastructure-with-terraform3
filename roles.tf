### Let's create an AssumeRole with an AssumeRole policy. It grants to an entity, in our case it is an EC2, permissions to assume the role.


resource "aws_iam_role" "ec2_instance_role" {
name = "ec2_instance_role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Sid    = ""
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = "aws assume role"
    },
  )
}


###Create IAM policy for this role
###This is where we need to define a required policy (i.e., permissions) according to our requirements. For example, allowing an IAM role to perform action describe applied to EC2 instances:
# Trying to commit everything

resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
  name        = "ec2_instance_policy"
  description = "A test policy"
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]

  })

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name =  "aws assume policy"
    },
  )

}

#Attach the Policy to the IAM Role
#This is where, we will be attaching the policy which we created above, to the role we created in the first step.


resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "test-attach" {
        role       = aws_iam_role.ec2_instance_role.name
        policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.policy.arn
    }

# Create an Instance Profile and interpolate the IAM Role
    resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ip" {
        name = "aws_instance_profile_test"
        role =  aws_iam_role.ec2_instance_role.name
    }
